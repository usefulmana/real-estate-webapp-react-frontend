### Dependencies <br>
 - bcrypt
 - body-parser
 - config
 - cors

 - jsonwebtoken

 ### Assumptions <br>
- When creating an ad, post date and expiration date (90 days after post date) is automatically determined recorded by the database.

### Report <br>
- I used a token-based authentication system for this project which is provided by a library called jsonwebtoken. This library is chosen because it is powerful and relatively easy to use. 
- Each user upon login or register will be granted a token which will be stored in session storage for security reason. When logging out or closing the tab, the token will be deleted.
- Each user can only CRUD their own ads and projects.
